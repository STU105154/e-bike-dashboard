# E-Bike Dashboard

This project is a browser-based dashboard designed to visualise public e-bike journey data. It transforms large, anonymised datasets into accessible visual summaries to help general audiences better understand sustainable transport patterns.

## Project Overview

The dashboard was created as part of a final-year dissertation project at Arden University. Its aim is to bridge the gap between open mobility data and public understanding by offering a simple, interpretable, and ethically responsible data visualisation tool.

It features:
- Visualisations of trip frequency by hour of day and day of week
- User type comparisons (subscribers vs casual riders)
- Fully static and client-side architecture (no backend or server required)
- Mobile-first responsive design for accessibility across devices
